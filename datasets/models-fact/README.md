# ModelsFact Dataset

This dataset contains 4.2k human factuality judgements:

CNN/DM:
 * 600 summaries generated by BART-Large
 * 600 summaries generated by BertSum (Liu and Lapata, 2019)
 * 600 summaries generated by PGConv (See et al., 2017)
 * 600 summaries generated by BottomUp (Gehrmann et al., 2018)
 * 600 summaries generated by AbsRL (Chen and Bansal, 2018)

XSum
 * 600 summaries generated by BART-Large
 * 600 summaries generated by BertSum

For each of these 4.2k summaries, one randomly selected sentence (displayed in context) was annotated for factuality by three annotators, and an aggregated judgement (produced by MACE) has been added.

## Fields

* `id`: ID between 0 and 10199
* `summary`: Complete summary
* `summary_sentence`: The randomly selected summary sentence that annotators judged for factuality
* `summary_sentence_contextleft`: Left context of the `summary_sentence`
* `summary_sentence_contextright`: Right context of the `summary_sentence`
* `abstractiveness_constraint`: Abstractiveness constraint used to generate this summary (`none`, `lambda2`, `lambda4`, `1/lambda2`, or `1/lambda1`, see [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02859))
* `annotator_comments`: Comments from the annotators
* `annotator_ids`: Anonymized annotator IDs
* `annotator_votes`: Factuality votes from the annotators (0=not factually consistent with the displayed document(s); 1=factually consistent)
* `annotator_votes_combined`: Aggregated factuality judgement from MACE
* `dataset_name`: Name of the dataset, i.e., `cnn_dailymail`, `xsum`, `multi_news_500`, or `multi_news_800`
* `document_full`: Complete input document(s) 
* `document_short`: Shortened document(s) displayed to the annotators, which contains the sentences most similar to the `summary_sentence`.
* `document_id`: Document ID
