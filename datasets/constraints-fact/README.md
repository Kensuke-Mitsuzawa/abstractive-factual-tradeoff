# ConstraintsFact Dataset

## Description

This dataset contains 10.2k human factuality judgements:

 * 600 x 4 summaries of CNN/DM input generated by BART-Large trained on CNN/DM (using 4 different abstractiveness decoding constraints)
 * 600 x 5 summaries of XSum input generated by BART-Large trained on XSum
 * 600 x 4 summaries of Multi-News input (truncated to 800 input tokens) generated by BART-Large trained on Multi-News (training data truncated to 800 input tokens)
 * 600 x 4 summaries of Multi-News input (truncated to 500 tokens) generated by BART-Large trained on Multi-News (training data truncated to 500 tokens -- more aggressive truncation means the model learns to hallucinate more)

For each of the 10.2k summaries, one randomly selected sentence (displayed in context) was annotated for factuality by three annotators, and an aggregated judgement (produced by MACE) has been added.

## Fields

* `id`: ID between 0 and 10199
* `summary`: Complete summary
* `summary_sentence`: The randomly selected summary sentence that annotators judged for factuality
* `summary_sentence_contextleft`: Left context of the `summary_sentence`
* `summary_sentence_contextright`: Right context of the `summary_sentence`
* `abstractiveness_constraint`: Abstractiveness constraint used to generate this summary (`none`, `lambda2`, `lambda4`, `1/lambda2`, or `1/lambda1`, see [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02859))
* `annotator_comments`: Comments from the annotators
* `annotator_ids`: Anonymized annotator IDs
* `annotator_votes`: Factuality votes from the annotators (0=not factually consistent with the displayed document(s); 1=factually consistent)
* `annotator_votes_combined`: Aggregated factuality judgement from MACE
* `dataset_name`: Name of the dataset, i.e., `cnn_dailymail`, `xsum`, `multi_news_500`, or `multi_news_800`
* `document_full`: Complete input document(s) 
* `document_short`: Shortened document(s) displayed to the annotators, which contains the sentences most similar to the `summary_sentence`.
* `document_id`: Document ID
